# "I need a regular expression to parse my HTML"

New programmers who want to extract information from an HTML document
often turn to regular expressions.

This is rarely a good idea.  HTML is an irregular language and regexes
are inadequate for the job.  You should use an HTML parser.

This site shows you how.


# To do

* Add more languages.
* Explain why regexes are bad.
* Explain how fragile regexes are.
