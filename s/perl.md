# Perl uses HTML::Parser

The CPAN module [HTML::Parser][6] is the basis for all HTML parsing
in Perl.  There are other CPAN modules that do parsing, but the
vast majority of them are just wrappers around HTML::Parser.

# Marpa::HTML

[Marpa::HTML][1] does "high-level" parsing of HTML.  It allows
handlers to be specified for elements, terminals and other components
in the hierarchical structure of an HTML document.  It's a is a
completely liberal HTML parser: it never rejects a document, no
matter how poorly that document fits the HTML standards.

The parsing method [Marpa::HTML][1] uses is totally new, as described
in "How to Parse HTML", Parts [one][2], [two][3] and [three][4].
Its [Marpa::XS][5] parse engine is in optimized C.

# WWW::Mechanize

[WWW::Mechanize][7] is a handy module because it handles two common
tasks associated with parsing HTML: fetching a remote document and
extracting basic information from a document.

    # Fetch the document located at $url
    $mech->get( $url );

Calling the `get()` subroutine handles all the lower level work of
using [LWP](https://metacpan.org/module/LWP) to fetch a page and
then [HTML::Parser][6] to build up a useful object. This `$mech`
object has numerous subroutines for accessing all of the data or
in a piecemeal fashion.

    # Get the text from the current object
    my $text = $mech->text();

    # Return all links
    my $links = $mech->links();

    # Return all images
    my $images = $mech->images();

    # Fetch the page title
    my $title = $mech->title();

[WWW::Mechanize][7] also provides `find_all_links()` and
`find_all_images()` for searching through all the links and images
that match a certain criteria, such as:

    # Find all links with link text of "Download"
    my @links = $mech->find_all_links( text => 'Download' );

    # Find all links that look like they might be download
    my @links = $mech->find_all_links( url_regex => qr/download/i );

# WWW::Mechanize::TreeBuilder

[WWW::Mechanize::TreeBuilder][8] is a combination of [WWW::Mechanize][7]
and [WWW::TreeBuilder][9] which brings the functionality of
[HTML::Element][10] with it. Now it is possible to search by tag
name or by attribute.

    use v5.10;
    use WWW::Mechanize;
    use WWW::Mechanize::TreeBuilder;

    my $mech = WWW::Mechanize->new;
    WWW::Mechanize::TreeBuilder->meta->apply($mech);

    $mech->get( 'http://htmlparsing.com/' );

    # Find all <h1> tags
    my @list = $mech->find('h1');

    # or this way
    my @list = $mech->look_down('_tag', 'h1');

    # Now just iterate and process
    foreach (@list) {
        say $_->as_text();
    }

`find()` searches by tag name whereas `look_down()` starts at `$mech`
and looks thru its element descendants (in pre-order), looking for
elements matching the criteria you specify. In the above example
we are using the internal attribute value `_tag` to search for
`<h1>` tags only. `look_down()` can use HTML attribute names, values
or be passed a coderef.

# xmlgrep

The [XML::Twig](http://search.cpan.org/dist/XML-Twig) module includes the
`xmlgrep` utility, which can often be good enough.  It doesn't parse,
but finds local matches.


# HTML::TableExtract

A fairly common requirement when parsing websites is to scrape data from a HTML
table.  [HTML::TableExtract](http://search.cpan.org/dist/HTML-TableExtract)
makes this easy and simple.

Quick example:

    my $html = LWP::Simple::get($url);
    my $te = HTML::TableExtract->new(
        headers => [ 'Date', 'Home Team', 'Away Team', 'Venue' ],
    );
    $te->parse($html);

    for my $row ($te->rows) {
        my ($date, $home, $away, $venue) = @$row;
    }

The above will find the first table on the page which has the headers mentioned,
and extract each row from it.  Looking for the table by the headers means that,
if extra columns are added or columns are moved about, your script will continue
to work perfectly.
